/// ITS NOT POSSIBLE PATRICK // Okay it is
//  Algo doesn't find it because it only checks expressions that can be reduced to simple left to right operations

//updated to add search paths for subtraction and division and prove myself wrong. algo now finds solution but I'd like to add steps print out

//Steps print out
